# Flutter KL Email Signature

This project contains a single HTML email signature for the Flutter Kuala Lumpur community.

## Scope

This repository is only for the email signature.

## Files

- `index.html`: Main email signature HTML.
- `assets/flutter_kuala_lumpur_full_logo.svg`: Logo used by the signature.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Copy the signature HTML into your email client signature settings.
3. Verify links and logo rendering in your client preview.

## Notes

- The signature is table-based to improve compatibility with email clients.
- If your email client does not render local asset paths (`assets/...`), host the logo online and replace the image `src` with a public URL.
